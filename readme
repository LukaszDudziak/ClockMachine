When I was studying, I discovered that using time and Intervals in apps and it's logic in programming is kinda hard for me to learn. That's why, my first self-made project, had to be something like this...Clock Machine, with alarm, different counters and stopwatch. 

For now (2020-07-29) it's just works. I've done zero optimalization and tests, but it look like working version. So in spare time (between next projects and udemy courses) i will add some things to upgrade this thingy :)

todo:
- manual testing all sections
- add sound alarm for alarm clock
- clock animation for current time  
- countdown's end effects (some "cool" animation maybe?)
